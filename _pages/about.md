Hi there!

I am currently a fourth semester integrated MS & PhD student in the [Digital Signal Processing and AI (DSP & AI) Lab](http://dsp.yonsei.ac.kr/) at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/sites/en_sc/index.do), advised by Prof. Hong-Goo Kang. Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Korea University at February 2024.

My academic interests lie in `multilingual speech and NLP technologies`. My ultimate goal is to develop a truly inclusive and generalizable model that supports both speech and text across diverse languages, including low-resource and even unseen ones. To this end, I am conducting research on a wide range of speech- and NLP-related tasks, including recognition, generation, and speech tokenization.

Beyond academics, I enjoy listening to music (particularly hip-hop), composing, and attending live performances and music festivals. I am also passionate about weight training and powerlifting, having trained since 2020.

I am always open to networking opportunities and conversations on shared interests—academic or otherwise—so please feel free to reach out!
