> Outside of research, I find balance through two main passions: **music** and **fitness**.  
> My fascination with audio and speech signal processing was initially fueled by a deep love for various music genres—especially Hip-Hop—while training at the gym provides a different kind of creative focus and clarity.

#### 🎵 **Music**
Music has always been a defining part of my life.
It was my curiosity about **how human voices and instruments produce and shape sound** that naturally evolved into my academic interest.
I enjoy listening across genres, from soulful R&B to lyrical Hip-Hop.
Lately, I’ve been captivated by the raw energy of live performances, catching international and Korean artists performing here in Seoul and beyond.
Currently, I’m really into the rage scene — enjoying artists like Ken Carson, Playboi Carti, Yeat, Osamason, and Homicide Gang.
Yet, above all, Mac Miller remains my favorite artist — his music and words have always offered me fresh emotions, quiet reflections, and a sense of connection I rarely find elsewhere.

Below are some of the live shows I’ve attended over the past few years:

- **Jun 2023 – AP Alchemy Compilation Concert (Seoul, South Korea)**  
  Attended to see *Swings*, a rapper who had a profound influence on my self-esteem and motivation.  

- **Sep 2023 – RapBeat Festival 2023 (Gwacheon, South Korea)**  
  Went to see *Joey Bada$$*, a boom-bap artist I’ve admired since 2015.  

- **Nov 2023 – UGRS: Rose From the Concrete (Seoul, South Korea)**  
  Attended to watch *Changmo*, one of the most lyrically expressive rappers in Korea.  

- **Aug 2024 – Ye x Ty Dolla $ign: Vultures Listening Experience (Goyang, South Korea)**  
  Witnessed an unexpected **live performance by Kanye West** — truly a once-in-a-lifetime moment.  

- **Sep 2024 – RapBeat Festival 2024 (Gwacheon, South Korea)**  
  Came to see *NAS*, the legendary “King of New York” and one of the most enduring figures in Hip-Hop.  

- **Sep 2025 – Chromakopia: The World Tour (Goyang, South Korea)**  
  Attended *Tyler, The Creator’s* tour celebrating his new album, a vibrant mix of music and visual artistry.  

- **Nov 2025 – Circus Maximus Stadium Tour (Goyang, South Korea)**  
  Saw *Travis Scott* live — the crowd energy was absolutely electric, especially during **“FE!N”**, which turned into six rounds of unforgettable moshpits.

#### 💪 **Workout**
I’m a dedicated **gymrat** who loves to train — particularly a mix of **weight training** and **powerlifting**.  
Working out clears my mind and recharges my energy for everything else in life.  

I’ve been training consistently since 2020, mainly focusing on **upper-body strength**, while keeping my leg sessions balanced.  
My current **total SBD** (Squat, Bench, Deadlift) is **505 kg**, broken down as follows:  
- **Squat:** 175 kg  
- **Bench Press:** 125 kg  
- **Deadlift:** 205 kg

#### 🎨 **Other Interests**
Outside of music and training, I enjoy exploring various creative outlets — **writing, fashion, perfume, and vinyl records**.  
I’m especially drawn to brands like **Chrome Hearts**, **Thug Club**, and **Tom Ford**, which embody a bold yet refined sense of individuality.
I also used to be deeply interested in music production, and some of my earlier works can be found on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jadedastone).
