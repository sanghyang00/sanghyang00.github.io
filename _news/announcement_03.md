🎤 I presented our paper, "[LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15299)", at **AAAI 2025** in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA — as an **oral presentation**. It was a tremendous honor to deliver my **first first-author paper** as an oral talk! 🥹✨
