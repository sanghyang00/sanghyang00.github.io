🎤 I presented our paper, "[UniCoM: A Universal Code-Switching Speech Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15244)", at **EMNLP 2025** in Suzhou, China.  
It was a tremendous honor to deliver my presentation, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to share our work with such an inspiring community! ✨🙌
